In general it takes the form of an ellipse, with the body sometimes closer in and sometimes further out. If you are given the distance $l_1$ of the closest approach that a planet makes to the Sun, also called <i>perihelion</i>, and its linear velocity $v_1$ at perihelion, then any other property of the orbit can be calculated from these two as follows."
